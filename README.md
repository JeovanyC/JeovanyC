## About Me

Hi!

My name is Jeovany, and I'm a Software Developer. I've always aspired to do something great with my life, so I started to dive into technology and math-related subjects. A while after that, I began learning programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, to look for a job.

I'm really interested in learning all kinds of new things. It's part of my life to have a strong need to explore topics I find interesting, and technology-related subjects are among the most fascinating out there. I'm looking to expand my knowledge of technology and related subjects through this GitHub profile.

Feel free to follow me on this journey! ðŸ‘Œ
